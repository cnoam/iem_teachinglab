Current state:

There is one Databricks workspace, used by K (e.g. 30) groups of students.

Each group contains 1 up to 4 students.

For each group (group_01, group_02...) there is a cluster (cluster_01 etc.)

Each group has privileges for its sole cluster

The users, groups are workspace entities (not account level)
The users/groups/clusters provisioning is done by existing terraform code.

-------

The 10000 feet goal: a customer (non technical, and without permissions) uses the system created by the (users == students). 
The system is a minimal http server whose backend connects to the DBR data and runs jobs and gets data. This data is then presented to the customer.
Ths http server will run on student's laptop -- it is just for demo.

The new required state:
A single SQL warehouse shall be used by all students (serverless or Pro) for their SQL queries. students will keep using their clusters as well.
A single Catalog shall be used by the users. 
Each group shall have its own schema. members of this group can do anything within this schema (create/delete etc. tables.)
Each group shall have access only to its own schema. a user may see that there are other schemas, but preferably see only her own.
Each group can create jobs. such jobs can for example run a notebook, SQL query, python code.
Each group shall be able to use SQL warehouse to perform queries. 
Each group shall be able to run the code in test_connection.py against their own entities, and not any other entities.

The final delivery to a group (of students) is a set of {url,SP ID + secret, etc.}
